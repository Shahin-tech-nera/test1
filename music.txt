[Verse 1: P!nk]
Right from the start
You were a thief, you stole my heart
And I, your willing victim
I let you see the parts of me
That weren't all that pretty
And with every touch, you fixed them

[Pre-Chorus: P!nk]
Now you've been talkin' in your sleep, oh, oh
Things you never say to me, oh, oh
Tell me that you've had enough of our love, our love

[Chorus: P!nk]
Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second, we're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again
It's in the stars
It's been written in the scars on our hearts
We're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again

[Verse 2: Nate Ruess, P!nk]
I'm sorry I don't understand
Where all of this is coming from
I thought that we were fine
(Oh, we had everything)
Your head is running wild again
My dear, we still have everythin'
And it's all in your mind
(Yeah, but this is happenin')

[Verse 1: Shakira]
She's playin' dumb all the time, just to keep it fun
To get you on like, "Ahh!" Be careful, amigo
She's talking and walking just to wake you up
She'd die for your love, but your love's only mine, boy
Yo sigo tranquila, like I'm on a beach in Anguilla
Sippin' my Corona like it's nothin' goin' on
I ain't leavin' you alone, what is meant for me
No other girl is gonna take it, so give him up

[Chorus: Shakira]
And I'm crazy, but you like it
Loca, loca, loca
You like that it ain't easy
Loca, loca, loca
I'm crazy but you like it
Loca, loca, loca
Crazy but you like it

[Verse 2: Dizzee Rascal, Shakira]
That girl is a nutter
Hot girl, I heat up when I touch her
Chica Caliente, got me rapping to merengue
I feel so el presidente
I'm runnin' shit and I'm lovin' it
She's got a mean lil' bopper, you should see what she does with it
She keeps it down low (Down low, down low)
I can never get enough, oh no, oh no
She gives me the runaround, but I stay chasin'
But I mean, yo, I'm in love with a crazy girl
But it's all good, and it's fine by me
Just as long as I hear her say, "Ay, papi"

You're the one for me

Though you think she got it all
I got my kiki
You're the one for me
And for her no more
Though you think she got it all
I got my kiki

[Verse 3: Shakira, Dizzee Rascal & El Cata]
I bet she doesn't know the things that I‚Äôd do to please you
I take you to the malec√≥n por el caminito
They saw your girlfriend looking for me with a rifle
'Cause, we‚Äôre dancin' Mambo, oh, what she don't allow it?
I really can't help it if I make the lady loca
I don't want no trouble, I just wanna hit the- ooh!
And I'm crazy, but you like it
'Cause the kinda girl like me, they're running out of in the market
(Shhh)


[Chorus: Shakira]
And I'm crazy, but you like it
Loca, loca, loca
You like that it ain't easy
Loca, loca, loca

You're the one for me
And for her no more
Though you think she got it all
I got my kiki

[Chorus: Shakira]
And I'm crazy, but you like it
Loca, loca, loca
You like that it ain't easy
Loca, loca, loca (Ca, loca-ca, loca-ca, loca)
