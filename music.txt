[Verse 1: P!nk]
Right from the start
You were a thief, you stole my heart
And I, your willing victim
I let you see the parts of me
That weren't all that pretty
And with every touch, you fixed them

[Pre-Chorus: P!nk]
Now you've been talkin' in your sleep, oh, oh
Things you never say to me, oh, oh
Tell me that you've had enough of our love, our love

[Chorus: P!nk]
Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second, we're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again
It's in the stars
It's been written in the scars on our hearts
We're not broken, just bent
And we can learn to love again

[Verse 2: Nate Ruess, P!nk]
I'm sorry I don't understand
Where all of this is coming from
I thought that we were fine
(Oh, we had everything)
Your head is running wild again
My dear, we still have everythin'
And it's all in your mind
(Yeah, but this is happenin')
